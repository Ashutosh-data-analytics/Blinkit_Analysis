# 📊 Blinkit Sales Analysis  
### End-to-End Data Analytics Project on a Large Dataset  
*(Excel | SQL | Python | Power BI)*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a **complete end-to-end Data Analytics case study** based on **Blinkit – India’s Last Minute App**, built using a **large, real-world structured dataset**.

The objective is to demonstrate the ability to **process, analyze, and visualize thousands of records**, convert **business requirements into KPIs**, and generate **actionable insights** for decision-making.

---

## 📦 Dataset Size & Complexity
- **Records:** 8,523+ transaction rows  
- **Attributes:** 12 business columns  
- **Dimensions Covered:**  
  - Products & Item Types  
  - Outlet Types  
  - Outlet Sizes  
  - Outlet Locations (Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3)  
  - Outlet Establishment Year  

This dataset size introduces **realistic aggregation, filtering, and performance challenges** across tools.

## 🎯 Business Objective
To analyze Blinkit’s sales data and answer key business questions:

- How is sales performance trending across years?
- Which product categories generate maximum revenue?
- How do outlet size and location impact large-scale sales?
- What is the overall customer satisfaction level?
- Which outlet types scale best in terms of revenue and volume?

## 📌 KPIs & Metrics Used

### 🔑 Primary (Executive) KPIs  
Defined via **Business Requirement / KPI PPT** and tracked across all tools:

- **Total Sales** – Overall revenue generated  
- **Average Sales** – Average revenue per transaction  
- **Number of Items Sold** – Sales volume indicator  
- **Average Rating** – Customer satisfaction score  

### 📊 Primary KPI Results (Full Dataset)
- **Total Sales:** $1.20M  
- **Average Sales:** $140.99  
- **Number of Items:** 8,523  
- **Average Rating:** 3.92  

---

### 📈 Additional KPIs & Analytical Metrics
Beyond the main 4 KPIs, the following metrics were derived to generate deeper insights:

- Sales by Outlet Type (Supermarket Type 1/2/3, Grocery Store)  
- Sales by Outlet Size (Small, Medium, High)  
- Sales by Outlet Location Tier  
- Sales Trend by Outlet Establishment Year  
- Item Visibility vs Sales Impact  
- Fat Content Performance (Low Fat vs Regular)  
- Top & Bottom Performing Item Categories  
- Outlet-wise Item Count Contribution  

These metrics explain **why performance varies** across outlets, products, and locations.

## 📊 Excel Analysis
Excel was used as the **initial analytical layer** to:
- Explore and understand 8,500+ records  
- Build pivot tables on large datasets  
- Validate KPIs defined in the PPT  
- Identify early trends and anomalies  

---

## 🧮 SQL Analysis
SQL served as the **core processing layer**:
- Standardized categorical values  
- Aggregated thousands of transactions  
- Computed KPIs using optimized `GROUP BY`  
- Performed outlet-, item-, and location-level analysis  

SQL outputs acted as the **single source of truth**.

---

## 🐍 Python Analysis
Python was used for **EDA and validation**:
- Data quality checks  
- KPI recalculation for accuracy  
- Trend and distribution analysis  
- Cross-verification with SQL results  

---

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard
Power BI was the **final reporting layer**, designed for:
- Fast filtering on large datasets  
- Multi-dimensional slicing  
- Business-friendly KPI visualization  
- Executive-level insights  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights & Findings
- **Tier 3 outlets** generate the highest total sales  
- **Medium-sized outlets** outperform small and large outlets  
- **Low Fat products** consistently outperform Regular products  
- **Fruits & Vegetables** and **Snack Foods** dominate revenue  
- **Supermarket Type 1** leads in both revenue and item volume  
- **Item visibility** has a measurable impact on sales performance
