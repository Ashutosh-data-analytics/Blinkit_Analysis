# 📊 Blinkit Sales Analysis  
### End-to-End Data Analytics Project on a Large Dataset  
*(Excel | SQL | Python | Power BI)*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a **complete end-to-end Data Analytics case study** based on **Blinkit – India’s Last Minute App**, built using a **large, real-world structured dataset**.

📦 **Dataset Size & Complexity**
- **Rows:** 8,523+ transaction records  
- **Columns:** 12 business attributes  
- **Dimensions:** Products, outlets, locations, outlet types, outlet sizes, and time (establishment year)

The project focuses on **efficiently handling, cleaning, aggregating, and visualizing thousands of records** and converting them into **actionable business insights** using industry-standard analytics tools.

## 🎯 Business Objective
To analyze Blinkit’s large sales dataset and answer critical business questions:
- How is overall sales performance trending across years?
- Which product categories drive the most revenue?
- How do outlet size and location affect large-scale sales?
- What is customer satisfaction across thousands of transactions?
- Which outlet types scale best in terms of revenue and volume?

---

## 📌 Key KPIs (Computed on Full Dataset)
All KPIs were calculated on the **entire dataset (8,523+ records)**:

- **Total Sales**
- **Average Sales**
- **Number of Items Sold**
- **Average Customer Rating**

### 📊 Overall Results
- **Total Sales:** $1.20M  
- **Average Sales:** $140.99  
- **Number of Items:** 8,523  
- **Average Rating:** 3.92

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies (Built for Scale)
- **Excel** – Initial exploration, pivot tables, KPI validation on large data  
- **SQL** – Core data cleaning, aggregation, KPI computation on thousands of rows  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – EDA and validation on full dataset  
- **Power BI** – Performance-optimized interactive dashboard

## 📊 Excel Analysis (Large Dataset Handling)
Excel was used as the **initial analytical layer** to:
- Explore and understand 8,500+ records
- Build pivot tables on large datasets
- Validate KPIs before automation
- Create an Excel dashboard for early insights

---

## 🧮 SQL Analysis (Core Processing Layer)
SQL was the **primary engine for large-scale data processing**:
- Standardized inconsistent categorical values
- Aggregated thousands of transactional records
- Computed KPIs using optimized `GROUP BY`
- Performed outlet, product, and location-level analysis
- Used advanced SQL concepts (`CASE`, `PIVOT`, window functions)

SQL outputs served as the **single source of truth**.

---

## 🐍 Python Analysis (EDA & Validation)
Python was used for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the full dataset:
- Efficient data loading and inspection
- Data quality checks and standardization
- KPI recalculation for cross-verification
- Trend and distribution visualization

---

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard (Performance-Optimized)
Power BI served as the **final reporting layer**, designed to handle:
- Thousands of records efficiently
- Fast slicer-based filtering
- Multi-dimensional analysis without performance lag

---

## 🔍 Key Insights from Large-Scale Data
- **Tier 3 outlets** generate the highest total sales
- **Medium-sized outlets** contribute maximum revenue
- **Low Fat products** outperform Regular products
- **Fruits & Vegetables** and **Snack Foods** dominate sales
- **Supermarket Type 1** scales best in revenue and item count

---

## ▶️ How to Use This Project
1. Review large raw datasets in the `raw-data` folder  
2. Explore Excel analysis for early KPI validation  
3. Examine SQL scripts for scalable transformations  
4. Review Python notebooks for EDA  
5. Open the Power BI dashboard for interactive insights
